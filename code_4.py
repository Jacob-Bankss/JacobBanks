#code works, wrote it myself. when copying from tony's examples, "#!/usr/bin/env python3" doesnt matter for code
#its there to tell the OS how to run the file when you execute it directly from the terminal
#problem: adding break at the end didnt work, telling me it was outside the loop. this was because
#i had to add "while True:" at the start so that a loop could start forever until something stops it. without adding this, there is no loop for break to exit from.
